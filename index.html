      <h1>Flashcards for learning JS & jQuery</h1>
      <p class="intro">Here is a list of Flashcards that can help you quickly learn about JS and jQuery. Simply click on the title to see the description, then click on the discription to shrink it back down.</p>

      <div class="well well-sm">
        <div id="javaHide">
          <h3>Javascript (JS)</h3>
        </div>
        <div id="javaShow">
          <p>Back in 1995, a developer at Netscape named Brendan Eich introduced JavaScript to the world. Despite Java and JavaScript both containing "Java" in their names, they're two distinct languages that have nothing to do with one another. The official name of JavaScript is ECMAScript which gets its name from the international organization that maintains it, ECMA (European Computer Manufacturer's Association).</p>
          <p>JavaScript is a programming language used to make web pages interactive. Like HTML and CSS, you do not need to install anything to begin writing JavaScript or see it run on your users' computers. All modern browsers support JavaScript which means JavaScript that you write for your web pages will automatically run when your visitors load your web page in their browsers. In fact, JavaScript is the only scripting language that all browsers support so if you want a page to have dynamic content, learning JavaScript is a must.</p>

        <div id="operHide">
          <h3>Operators</h3>
        </div>
        <div id="operShow">
          <p>The most commonly used operators are <strong>Assignment Operators</strong>, and <strong>Comparison Operators</strong>.</p>
          <h4><strong>Assignment Operators:</strong></h4>
          <p>Changes the value of the variable on the left of the operator.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>= assing variable on left of operator value on right of operator</li>
            <li>+= increase balue of variable on left of operator by value on right of operator</li>
            <li>-= decrease value of variable on left of operator by value on right of operator</li>
            <li>*= multiply value of variable on left of operator by value on right of operator</li>
            <li>/= divide value of variable on left of operator by value on right of operator</li>
          </ul>
          <h4><strong>Comparison Operators:</strong></h4>
          <p>Does not change any values, but returns a boolean (true or false) depending on whether the statement evaluates as true or false.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>(===) is equal to</li>
            <li>(!==) is not equal to</li>
            <li>(>) greater than</li>
            <li>(>=) greater than or equal to</li>
            <li>(<) less than</li>
            <li>(<=) less than or equal to</li>

        <div id="varHide">
          <h3>Variables</h3>
        </div>
        <div id="varShow">
          <p><strong>Variables</strong> can be thought of as containers used to store information. They allow for a way to label data with a descriptive name.</p>
          <p>Use <em>lowerCamelCase</em> when naming JavaScript variables. Start with a lowercase letter, and if the variable name is more than one word, remove all spaces and capitalize the first letter of each subsequent word.</p>
          <p><strong>var:</strong>Always use the var keyword when initializing variables in JavaScript.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

        <div id="vncHide">
          <h3>Variable naming conventions</h3>
        </div>
        <div id="vncShow">
          <h4><strong>Tips</strong></h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Variables should begin with a letter.</li>
            <li>Variables are case sensitive (<strong>myNumber</strong> is a <em>different</em> variable than <strong>myNUMBER</strong>).</li>
            <li>Use clear names that describe the value being stored like <strong>myNumber</strong>.</li>
            <li>Always name your variables in a manner that will be easy for other developers to understand. Avoid vague letters or initials. (For example: <strong>var x = 45</strong> doesn't tell us what the value is. Is 45 an age, a distance, size, a time?...)</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

        <div id="funShow">

          <h4>Three different Functions</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>alert()</strong> opens a dialog box and returns <strong>undefined</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>confirm()</strong> opens a dialog box and returns a boolean.</li>
            <li><strong>prompt()</strong> opens a dialog box and returns a string.</li>
